# Project Repository

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that focus on machine learning and statistical analysis tasks. The main contents of the repository are two Jupyter notebooks: `tasks.ipynb` and `project.ipynb`.

## `tasks.ipynb`

### Purpose:
The `tasks.ipynb` notebook addresses various machine learning and statistical tasks. 
These include implementing 
- a square root function using Newton's method;
- performing a chi-squared test on a contingency table;
- conducting a t-test on penguin body mass data;
- evaluating the separability of iris flower classes;
- performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the iris dataset.

### Instructions:
Download `tasks.ipynb` file to your machine or clone the repository. 
To run the code in this Jupyter notebook, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries specified at the beginning of the notebook. Execute each cell sequentially to observe the results of each task.

## `project.ipynb`

### Purpose:
The `project.ipynb` notebook focuses on exploring classification algorithms using the iris flower dataset associated with Ronald A Fisher.
 The project involves explaining supervised learning, describing classification algorithms, and implementing at least one common classification algorithm using the `scikit-learn` Python library. The notebook emphasizes the use of appropriate plots, mathematical notation, and diagrams to explain relevant concepts.

### Instructions:
To run the code in this Jupyter notebook, make sure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries as indicated at the beginning of the notebook. Execute each cell sequentially to follow the exploration of classification algorithms on the iris dataset.
